        my projects
    </h3>
    <p>
        At camp, I worked on astroids, and game maker. I got a high score of 10. I am currently working on a Scratch project.

    <p>
        The astroids game I made looked really cool, till I destoyed it. I was happy with the Scratch game though. I like making orange cats duplicate and turn rainbow while doing frontflips saying "cheese" ðŸ˜ƒ
